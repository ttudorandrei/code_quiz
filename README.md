Coding Quiz Game

## Description

As developers, we were tasked with building a Quiz web application.

When the Quiz starts, the questions are presented to the user in a random order.

When Name is submitted, it is stored along with the High Score.

If the user choses a wrong answer, he will loose 10 seconds and a "Wrong!" message will appear at the top of de screen.

User will not be able to progress to the next question without choosing the correct answer for the current one.

The time remaining at the end of the quiz is saved as the users High Score.

If all the questions are answered or the timer ends, the game is ended.

User can clear High Score.

User can return to the main quiz page from High Score page and start the game again.

User can view High Score by clicking the High Score link on top left corner of the start page.
